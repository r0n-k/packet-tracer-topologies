🏫 Campus-Scale Network Topology and Segmentation Project

📝 Overview
This project models a multi-department educational/research network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Key objectives are reliability, segmentation, reproducibility, and practical documentation for peer/instructor review. Multiple topologies—star, bus, ring, mesh, hybrid—demonstrate the network's scalability and departmental isolation.

Configured on Cisco Packet Tracer 9.0.

Segmentation matches real department/lab boundaries using custom topologies and subnets.

IP scheme: 192.168.[department/lab].[device] (see device lists above).

Focused on reproducibility: setup steps, testing, and documentation.

✅ Fully supported/tested

⚠️ Partially supported or single-point vulnerability

N/A Not segmented

🧩 Troubleshooting Checklist
Use Packet Tracer’s ipconfig to verify device IPs.

Ping between endpoints for connectivity/isolation.

Simulate cable/switch failures—observe mesh and ring recovery.

Review VLAN/ACL settings for extended security (if configured).

Confirm printer/DHCP allocation meets requirements.

📈 Conclusions
Achieved clear logical and physical separation per department.

Mesh/ring topologies enable self-healing and redundancy.

Documentation allows reproducible deployment for education, review, or extension.

🏁 How To Reproduce
Download .pkt file (provided separately).

Open in Cisco Packet Tracer (v9.0+).

Review each segment in project images and device/IP lists.

Run tests (ping, unplug cables, check interfaces).

Reference this documentation for setup/context.
