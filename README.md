# Integrated Network Topologies Lab

This Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrates several fundamental network topologies—all integrated into a single simulation environment for practical learning.
Created as part of my B.Sc. Cybersecurity coursework, the project aims to deepen understanding of physical and logical network designs found in real-world organizations.

## Topologies Included
- **Star Topology:**  
  Standard department network with devices connected to a central switch.
- **Bus Topology:**  
  Chemistry lab setup with devices connected in a line.
- **Ring Topology:**  
  Research lab with devices forming a ring for redundancy.
- **Mesh Topology:**  
  Computer department network with high-availability links.
- **Hybrid/Integrated:**  
  All subnets/departments are interconnected as in a campus.
- **VC Office:**  
  Small office hub and essential device setup.

## How to Use

1. Download the Packet Tracer file from this repository.
2. Open with Cisco Packet Tracer (version 1.1.6 or later).
3. Review the diagrams and device configurations.
4. Simulate connectivity and explore various networking scenarios.

## Learning Outcomes

- Identify and configure different physical/logical topologies.
- Analyze integrated departmental networks.
- Troubleshoot connectivity across diverse environments.
- Gain hands-on practice in campus-wide network design.

## Student Context
This project was developed as a practical practice during my B.Sc. Cybersecurity 2nd year. 
It highlights my ability to design, document, and integrate multiple network environments using Cisco Packet Tracer—key skills.
